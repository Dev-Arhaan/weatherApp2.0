# weatherApp - weatherio

🌤️ Excited to share my second web app! 🌦️ <br>

I've built a sleek and user-friendly website that connects to the OpenWeatherMap API, providing real-time weather information with just a few clicks. 🌍⛅ <br>

Now you can easily check the visibility, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and even get a 24-hour forecast or a glimpse of the next 5 days' weather conditions, all in one place! 🌬️🌡️💧 <br>

Check out my app and stay informed about the weather wherever you are! ☀️🌧️❄️ <br>
